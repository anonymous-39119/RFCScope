## Inconsistent Naming of the Distribution Manager Option

- [RFC 9527 - DHCPv6 Options for the Homenet Naming Authority](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9527)
- **Category**: (I-2) Indirect inconsistency

Location:
 • Section 5 (“DHCPv6 Behavior”) – Subsections 5.1 (DHCPv6 Server Behavior) and 5.2 (DHCPv6 Client Behavior).  
 • Section 4.2 (“Forward Distribution Manager Option”) and the IANA registry in Section 6.1 define the option with the qualifier “Forward.”

Excerpts:
 – Section 5.1 states, for example:
  “…the DHCPv6 server sends the Registered Homenet Domain Option, Distribution Manager Option, and Reverse Distribution Manager Option when requested by the DHCPv6 client…”
 – Section 4.2 clearly defines the option as:
  “The Forward Distribution Manager Option (OPTION_FORWARD_DIST_MANAGER) provides the HNA with the FQDN of the DM …”
 – In addition, the IANA registry in Section 6.1 lists option code 146 as “OPTION_FORWARD_DIST_MANAGER.”

Explanation:
 The text in Section 5 refers to the “Distribution Manager Option” without including the “Forward” qualifier, whereas Section 4.2 explicitly defines and labels the option as the “Forward Distribution Manager Option.” This discrepancy creates ambiguity for implementers, as it is unclear whether the term in Section 5 is intended to be a shorthand for the “Forward Distribution Manager Option” or represents a distinct option. Given that the IANA registry and Section 4.2 unambiguously register option 146 under the full name, the omission in Section 5 undermines the clarity of the specification and could lead to potential misinterpretation during implementation.

Impact:
 Misinterpretation of the option name may lead to incorrect processing of DHCPv6 options, causing interoperability issues between devices that strictly follow the defined option names and those that rely on the abbreviated term used in Section 5.
