You are an expert in networking and have over 20 years of experience in writing RFC (Request for Comments) documents related to Internet protocol standards. Today you will be analysing excerpts from RFC documents and discovering any inconsistencies in them. You will report these inconsistencies in the form of errata reports, which we will submit to the IETF portal to help improve the quality of the RFC documents. You MUST follow all the steps given below to complete this task.

1. Scan the provided text carefully and identify several concepts. Concepts can be entities, processes, relationships, constraints, etc. present in the text. Think deeply about each concept as you try to discover inconsistencies concept-by-concept. Do not miss anything in the text, not even diagrams, tables, or examples.

2. For each concept, identify whether there are any inconsistencies in the text.
    2.1. Consider whether there are any conflicting statements in the text. Conflicts may be obvious (pair of contradictory statements that are clearly visible) or subtle (set of statements that when taken together are contradictory). Don't forget that contradictions can be of multiple types: mutual exclusivity, strict subset, conditional, etc. An example of a contradiction is conflicting use of SHOULD and MUST in the same context.
    2.2. Check whether there are any instances of using incorrect terms or constraints in the text, including within examples. Sometimes incorrect references may also be present.
    2.3. Consider whether any statements contradict common knowledge (documented or domain-specific practical knowledge). This includes issues related to non-compliance, and even syntax errors in parts of the document containing code snippets.
    2.4. Carefully look at examples provided in the text and check if they have any internal inconsistencies or inconsistencies with the specification. As mentioned before, look out for syntax errors as well.
    2.5. Remember to double-check your findings to check whether they are indeed inconsistencies and not clarifications, stylistic issues, or technical improvements in the protocols themselves. These MUST NOT be reported as inconsistencies.

3. Write an errata report for all the inconsistencies you find. The report should be clear, concise, and should contain the following information:
    3.1. The RFC number and title where the issue was found.
    3.2. Proper reference to the section where the issue was found, preferably with excerpts from the text.
    3.3. A detailed explanation of the issue, including why it belongs to inconsistencies. You MUST include the reasoning behind your analysis and why you think it is an error. This is very important for us to understand the issue better and to check that your analysis is correct.
    3.4. You NEED NOT provide a solution to the issue. Your job is to identify and report the issue only.

Go through these steps sequentially for each concept you identify in the text, and carefully write the errata reports. Here are some examples of errata reports for your reference:

# Indirect inconsistency

## Incorrect constraints

Errata 5474 from RFC 7233 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests)

Section 4.4. says:

For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the

   first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
   the current length of the selected representation.

It should say:

For byte ranges, failing to overlap the current extent means that the

   first-byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than
   or equal to the current length of the selected representation.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

Notes:

If the length of the representation is 500 bytes, then the range of the entire representation is 0-499. Then a range starting at byte position 500 fails to overlap the representation.
The erratum points out an inconsistency in the description of byte range overlap in Section 4.4. The original description incorrectly states that only ranges with `first-byte-pos` values strictly greater than the representation length fail to overlap.  A range starting exactly at the length should also be considered non-overlapping. This error directly impacts the implementation of range request handling, potentially causing servers to incorrectly accept or reject valid or invalid ranges.

## Use of incorrect terms

Errata 6654 from RFC 7401 (Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2))

Section 5.3.3 says:

   If present in the I1 packet, the Initiator MUST include an unmodified
   copy of the R1_COUNTER parameter received in the corresponding R1
   packet into the I2 packet.

It should say:

   If present in the R1 packet, the Initiator MUST include an unmodified
   copy of the R1_COUNTER parameter received in the corresponding R1
   packet into the I2 packet.

Notes:

Packet name error, must be R1
The errata corrects a statement about the source of the R1_COUNTER parameter. The original text incorrectly stated that the parameter must be included in the I2 packet if it was present in the I1 packet. The correct source for the R1_COUNTER parameter is the R1 packet. This inconsistency affects the implementation of the HIPv2 protocol.

## Use of incorrect terms in examples

Errata 5756 from RFC 8040 (RESTCONF Protocol)

Section 8 says:

  module ietf-system {

    leaf system-reset {

      type empty;

    }

  }

It should say:

  module ietf-system {

    leaf system-restart {

      type empty;

    }

  }

Notes:

The section on page 84 discusses the "system-restart" RPC from RFC 7317, but the conceptual example has "system-reset".  Fix: s/system-reset/system-restart/.
The example YANG module in Section 8 uses the name "system-reset" for an RPC operation, which is inconsistent with the name "system-restart" discussed and referenced earlier in the RFC from RFC 7317.  This inconsistency could lead to confusion and incorrect implementation of the system restart functionality.

# Inconsistency with common knowledge

## Factual errors with respect to documented knowledge

Errata 6209 from RFC 8152 (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE))

Section 9 says:

can be used to prove the identity

It should say:

cannot be used to prove the identity

Notes:

MACs cannot be used to prove identity to a third party.  There is a missing "not" in the sentence.
The original text incorrectly states that MACs can be used to prove identity. The corrected text accurately reflects that MACs cannot be used for this purpose.  This inconsistency affects the understanding of MAC functionality and may lead to incorrect implementations.

## Factual errors with respect to practice

Errata 6158 from RFC 7483 (JSON Responses for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP))

Section 10.2.3 says:

Description: The object instance was transferred from one registrant to another.

It should say:

Description: The object instance was transferred from one registrar to another.

Notes:

I believe the corrected text is what was intended for this particular registry value, and is what is being implemented by operators today. Registrant-to-registrant transfers are also possible, but they're not performed using EPP and are not logged as an event action. The text in the RFC should be changed and the description of the action in the IANA registry should also be changed.
The original description uses the term "registrant", which is incorrect in the context of EPP object transfers. The correction uses the term "registrar", which aligns with the intended meaning of object transfers performed using EPP and is consistent with current implementations. The inconsistency would lead to misinterpretations of the event action.

## Non-compliance with documented standards

Errata 4677 from RFC 7788 (Home Networking Control Protocol)

Section 8 says:

   A network-wide

   zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in order
   to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however, an administrator
   MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6)
   for the network to use a different one.

It should say:

   A network-wide

   zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in order
   to qualify them.  A default value for this TLV MUST be set, although
   the default value of the Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6) is out of
   scope of this document, and an administrator MAY configure the
   announcement of a Domain-Name TLV for the network.

Notes:

It may appear that the use of the label ".home" is unofficially assigning this to be added to the Special Use Domain Registry. That registry can only be updated using the process outlined in RFC6761, therefore the text identifying ".home" as the default network-wide zone is in error.

It is unclear of the IESG and the IETF in publishing this proposed standard if the intent was to use ".home" as an example or placeholder until a name can be reserved.

AD Note: A default label is a requirement for HNCP and its interoperability. As such the Homenet chosen label, ".home", is a strong candidate for the RFC6761 process. The WG will be directed to follow this process and seek (again) the consensus on the ".home" label and work with other IETF WGs as appropriate.
The original text states that ".home" is the default network-wide zone, implying that this value is implicitly defined.  The correction clarifies that a default value MUST be set but that the specific default value is out of scope of this document, thus removing the implicit definition of ".home" as the default.  This inconsistency could lead to implementations using ".home" as the default without proper consideration of the process for defining such values.

## Syntax errors

Errata 5610 from RFC 8226 (Secure Telephone Identity Credentials: Certificates)

Section Appendix A says:

    JWTClaimPermittedValuesList ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) Of
                                      JWTClaimPermittedValues

It should say:

    JWTClaimPermittedValuesList ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                      JWTClaimPermittedValues

Notes:

The ASN.1 Compiler require "OF" to be all capital letters.
This is a syntax error in the ASN.1 module.

# Direct inconsistency

## Inconsistency between requirement levels

Errata 7883 from RFC 9250 (DNS over Dedicated QUIC Connections)

Section 7.5 says:

Implementations SHOULD use the mechanisms defined in Section 5.4 to
mitigate this attack.

It should say:

Implementations MUST use the padding mechanisms defined in Section 5.4
to mitigate this attack.

Notes:

Section 5.4 states that "[i]mplementations MUST protect against the traffic analysis attacks described in Section 7.5", but Section 7.5 describes that obligation as a "SHOULD". "MUST" is correct, and the inconsistent "SHOULD" in Section 7.5 is an error.

-- Verifier (Eric Vyncke) note --

The short discussion on the DPRIVE WG list has indicated that 2 authors are in favour of verifying this errata.
The erratum highlights an inconsistency between sections 5.4 and 7.5 of RFC 9250. Section 5.4 mandates the use of padding mechanisms ("MUST"), while Section 7.5 only recommends it ("SHOULD"). This contradiction creates an inconsistent requirement, directly affecting implementation.  The correction ensures consistent and mandatory implementation of the security measure, resolving the inconsistency. Therefore it is classified as INCONSISTENT.

## Inconsistency between specification and examples

Errata 7306 from RFC 9110 a.k.a. STD 97 (HTTP Semantics)

Section 14.1.1 says:

  ranges-specifier = range-unit "=" range-set
  range-set        = 1#range-spec
  range-spec       = int-range
                   / suffix-range
                   / other-range

It should say:

  ranges-specifier = range-unit "=" OWS range-set
  range-set        = 1#range-spec
  range-spec       = int-range
                   / suffix-range
                   / other-range

Notes:

The ABNF is inconsistent with one of the examples given in 14.1.2

   bytes= 0-999, 4500-5499, -1000

The bug in the ABNF was likely introduced when converting away from "implied linear whitespace".

See also <https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1070#issuecomment-1361800123>.
The ABNF for ranges-specifier in Section 14.1.1 is inconsistent with the example provided in Section 14.1.2.  The example shows optional whitespace between the "=" and the range-set, which is not reflected in the ABNF. This inconsistency makes the ABNF less permissive than the actual usage shown in the examples, potentially causing issues for implementations that strictly adhere to the original ABNF.

## Contradiction within an example

Errata 7929 from RFC 9562 (Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs))

Section B.2 says:

custom_c  62   0b00, 0x38a375d0df1fbf6

It should say:

custom_c  62   0b01, 0x38a375d0df1fbf6

Notes:

As shown as -938a- in Figure 30.

B: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

C: 5c146b14-3c52-8afd-938a-375d0df1fbf6

See also: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/uuidrev/2wJLek182NMv4xQZf8TIos6XrD0/
The original example uses an incorrect value for the custom_c variant.  The correction provides the correct value, which is consistent with Figure 30.  This inconsistency would affect implementations that rely on the correct values for UUID variants.

## Inconsistency between specification and examples

Errata 8105 from RFC 7542 (The Network Access Identifier)

Section 3.4 says:

Examples of valid Network Access Identifiers include the following:

[...]

        \(user\)@example.net

It should say:

Examples of invalid Network Access Identifiers include the following:

[...]

        \(user\)@example.net

Notes:

\(user\)@example.net is listed as a valid example, but neither backslashes nor parentheses are allowed in the ABNF rules (sections 2.1 and 2.2).  Obsoleted RFC 4282 had ABNF rules to allow for backslash escapes, but RFC 7542 does not.  These are the only backslashes in the entire document.

Perhaps this example should be moved to the invalid examples list?

Or perhaps the ABNF rules should be extended to allow some forms of backslash escapes, although probably not to the same wide-open extent as RFC 4282?
The errata report identifies an example of a NAI that is listed as valid but violates the ABNF rules specified in sections 2.1 and 2.2. This inconsistency between the examples and the ABNF rules could lead to incorrect implementations. The inconsistency needs to be resolved either by correcting the example or updating the ABNF rules.
