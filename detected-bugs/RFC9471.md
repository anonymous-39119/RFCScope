## Ambiguous Definition of Cyclic Dependencies for Sibling Domain Name Servers

- [RFC 9471 - DNS Glue Requirements in Referral Responses](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9471)
- **Category**: (U-2) Direct under-specification (incomplete constraints)
- **Status**: Confirmed by authors.

Excerpt from Section 2.3:  
  “The use of sibling domain name servers can introduce cyclic dependencies. This happens when one domain specifies name servers from a sibling domain, and vice versa. This type of cyclic dependency can only be broken when the delegating name server includes glue for the sibling domain in a referral response.”

Explanation:  
While Section 2.3 provides a clear two‑zone example of a cyclic dependency, it neither defines the term “cyclic dependency” in general nor clarifies whether its guidance applies solely to direct, pairwise cycles or also to more complex inter–zone relationships. For example, consider a scenario where zone A delegates to B, zone B delegates to C, and zone C (directly or indirectly) delegates back to A—forming a triangular cycle. Without a precise definition or additional constraints, some implementations might choose to include glue records to break the cycle for all involved zones, whereas others might not, leading to unpredictable resolution behavior. This ambiguity under-specifies the required behavior and may result in diverging implementations when handling more complex dependency graphs.
