## Ambiguous "Longest Match" Definition and Missing Tie‐Breaking Guidance

- [RFC 9224 - Finding the Authoritative Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Service](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9224)
- **Category**: (U-3) Indirect under-specification
- **Status**: Confirmed by authors.

Excerpt from Section 5:
 “For IP address space, the authoritative registration data service is found by doing a longest match of the target address with the values of the arrays in the corresponding RDAP Bootstrap Service Registry for Address Space. The longest match is done the same way as in packet forwarding: the addresses are converted in binary form and then the binary strings are compared to find the longest match up to the specified prefix length.”
 …and later:
 “The longest match method enables covering prefixes of a larger address space pointing to one base RDAP URL while more specific prefixes within the covering prefix are being served by another base RDAP URL.”

Explanation:
The RFC relies on the informal phrase “the same way as in packet forwarding” without providing a precise, formal definition of how to compare the binary representations or how to resolve cases where two registry entries have the same (most specific) prefix length. (In contrast, Section 4 for domain names explicitly states that if the longest match results in multiple entries they are considered equivalent.) This lack of guidance on tie-breaking constitutes an underspecification that may lead to divergent implementations of RDAP clients for Internet numbers.
