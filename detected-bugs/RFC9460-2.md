## Ambiguity in the directive regarding SVCB queries for “http”/“https” schemes

- [RFC 9460 - Service Binding and Parameter Specification via the DNS (SVCB and HTTPS Resource Records)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9460)
- **Category**: (I-1) Direct inconsistency

Excerpt from Section 9:
 “… To enable special handling for HTTP use cases, the HTTPS RR type is defined as a SVCB‐compatible RR type, specific to the ‘https’ and ‘http’ schemes. Clients MUST NOT perform SVCB queries or accept SVCB responses for ‘https’ or ‘http’ schemes.”

Explanation:
 In the opening paragraph of Section 9 the specification prohibits “SVCB queries or [the] acceptance of SVCB responses” for URIs using “http” or “https” schemes. Yet, in context the document later defines the HTTPS RR type (RR type 65) as the appropriate SVCB‐compatible record for these very schemes.
 The intended operational behavior is for clients to use HTTPS RR queries (RR type 65) for “http”/“https” URLs rather than the generic SVCB queries (RR type 64). As written, the blanket prohibition may be misinterpreted by implementers to mean that no DNS query for service binding information should be performed for HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.
 This ambiguity, although not a fundamental protocol error, risks implementation confusion and could lead to improper handling of service binding information.
 A clarified statement should explicitly require that for “http” or “https” URIs the client MUST perform HTTPS RR queries and MUST refrain from using generic SVCB queries.

Impact:
 If left unclarified, some implementations might entirely omit DNS lookups for service binding information for HTTP/HTTPS resources, undermining optimizations and security features that this RFC is intended to provide.
