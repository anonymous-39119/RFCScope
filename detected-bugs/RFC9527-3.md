## Incorrect Reference to DM versus RDM in Section 4.3

- [RFC 9527 - DHCPv6 Options for the Homenet Naming Authority](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9527)
- **Category**: (I-2) Indirect inconsistency
- **Status**: Awaiting response from authors.

Excerpt from Section 4.3:  
  "The Reverse Distribution Manager Option (OPTION_REVERSE_DIST_MANAGER) provides the HNA with the FQDN of the DM as well as the transport protocols for the communication between the HNA and the DM."

Proposed Correction/Clarification:  
  The text should refer to the “RDM” rather than “DM” so that it correctly states that the option provides the HNA with the FQDN of the Reverse Distribution Manager (RDM).

Explanation:  
In this section the option is intended for conveying reverse channel configuration. While the diagram and later field description clearly specify “Reverse Distribution Manager FQDN,” the opening sentence mistakenly uses “DM.” This discrepancy creates an internal contradiction and may cause implementers to confuse the forward and reverse management entities. The error likely results from a copy–paste oversight and should be corrected to ensure that the FQDN provided is unequivocally that of the RDM.
