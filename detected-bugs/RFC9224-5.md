## Undefined Term "terminating string"

- [RFC 9224 - Finding the Authoritative Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Service](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9224)
- **Category**: (U-1) Direct under-specification (undefined terms)
- **Status**: Pending

Excerpt from Section 9:  
  “…queries using search patterns that do not contain a terminating  
   string that matches some entries in the registries”

Issue:  
The term “terminating string” is used in describing search queries for which bootstrapping does not occur, yet the document provides no definition or guidance regarding what exactly constitutes a “terminating string.” There is no indication whether this term denotes a fixed suffix, the final label in a domain name, or another pattern requirement. Consequently, different RDAP clients might interpret this requirement differently.

Reasoning and Example:  
• Without a precise definition, one client might treat a query like “example” as having no terminating string (thus, denying bootstrapping), while another might assume that the entire string “example” suffices as a terminating string.  
• This divergence can lead to situations where identical queries result in different bootstrap server selections, thereby impacting interoperability.
