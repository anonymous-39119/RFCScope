## Ambiguous and Inconsistent Presentation of the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO Attribute Fields in Examples

- [RFC 9464 - Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) Configuration for Encrypted DNS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9464)
- **Category**: (I-1) Direct inconsistency
- **Status**: Confirmed by authors.

Detailed Description of the Issue:  
The specification defines the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO attribute as follows:  
 – In the CFG_REQUEST case (Figure 3), the payload consists of two consecutive one‐octet fields (“Num Hash Algs” and “ADN Length”). Here, ADN Length MUST be set to 0 and “Num Hash Algs” is implicitly determined from the overall Length (i.e. (Length–2)/2).  
 – In the CFG_REPLY (or CFG_SET) case (Figure 4), the “Num Hash Algs” field is explicitly required to be set to 1.  

However, the shorthand examples in Section A use the notation:  
 • Figure 5 (CFG_REQUEST Example):  
  ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO(0, (SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512))  
 • Figure 6 (CFG_REPLY Example):  
  ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO(0, SHA2-256, 8b6e7a5971cc6bb0b4db5a71…)
 
In both examples the leading “0” is used. This creates ambiguity because:  
 – In CFG_REPLY, the first one‐octet field (corresponding to “Num Hash Algs”) MUST be 1 per the specification, yet the example shows 0.  
 – The shorthand notation does not clearly distinguish between the two separate fields (“Num Hash Algs” and “ADN Length”), so a reader may mistakenly interpret the “0” as the “Num Hash Algs” value rather than as the (fixed) ADN Length or as part of a combined notation.  

Impact:  
This ambiguous presentation in the examples may lead implementers to misparse the attribute. In particular, setting an incorrect “Num Hash Algs” value (0 instead of 1 in CFG_REPLY or an unintended computed value in CFG_REQUEST) can cause faulty processing of the hash algorithm list and subsequent certificate digest validation failures during IKEv2 exchanges.

Recommendation:  
It is recommended that the examples be revised so that they explicitly reflect the two distinct one‐octet fields. For example, the CFG_REPLY example should be updated to show both a “Num Hash Algs” value of 1 and an “ADN Length” field (e.g., ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO(1, 0, SHA2-256, …)). Alternatively, a clarifying note should be added to indicate that in the shorthand notation the first value represents the ADN Length only (with “Num Hash Algs” implicitly set to the mandated default), but this note must make clear that for CFG_REPLY the value is expected to be 1.
