## Inconsistent Fallback Behavior Specification in the Internet Numbers Section

- [RFC 9224 - Finding the Authoritative Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Service](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9224)
- **Category**: (U-3) Indirect under-specification
- **Status**: Pending

Relevant Excerpt from Section 5.1 (IPv4 Example):  
 “For example, a query for "192.0.2.1/25" matches the "192.0.0.0/8" entry and the "192.0.2.0/24" entry in the example registry above. The latter is chosen by the client because it is the longest match. The base RDAP URL for this query is then taken from the second element of the array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry. The client chooses one of the base URLs from this array; in this example, it chooses the only one available, "https://example.org/". The {resource} specified in [RFC9082] is then appended to the base URL to complete the query. The complete query is then "https://example.org/ip/192.0.2.1/25".”

Contrast with Other Related Sections:  
 • Section 5.2 (IPv6 Address Space) and Section 5.3 (AS Number Space) both include an explicit note stating that “if the target RDAP server does not answer, the client can then use another URL prefix from the array.”

Issue Explanation:  
The IPv4 registry description (Section 5.1) does not mention fallback behavior when the chosen RDAP server fails to respond. By contrast, the IPv6 (Section 5.2) and AS number (Section 5.3) sections expressly state that clients should try an alternate URL prefix if the primary server does not answer. This discrepancy creates an inconsistency within the specification: clients processing IPv4 queries may not implement the fallback mechanism, leading to divergent behaviors between IPv4 and other Internet Number queries. Given that consistent error handling is critical for interoperability and reliable client implementations, clarifying the fallback behavior in Section 5.1 is necessary.
