## Inconsistent Naming in Section 4.3 Heading

- [RFC 9527 - DHCPv6 Options for the Homenet Naming Authority](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9527)
- **Category**: (I-2) Indirect inconsistency

Excerpt from Section 4.3 Heading:  
  "Reverse Distribution Manager Server Option"

Proposed Correction/Clarification:  
  The heading should be modified to “Reverse Distribution Manager Option” (omitting the word “Server”) to match the descriptive text in the body of the section and the official IANA registry entry.

Explanation:  
Although the body text and IANA table consistently refer to the option as “OPTION_REVERSE_DIST_MANAGER” or “Reverse Distribution Manager Option,” the heading erroneously includes the qualifier “Server.” This extra term could mislead implementers into assuming that the option applies only to server-specific behavior. Consistency in terminology is essential for clear implementer guidance. Therefore, the heading should be changed to align with the rest of the document.
