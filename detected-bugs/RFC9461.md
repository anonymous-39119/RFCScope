 Appendix A, Table 3 of RFC 9461  
  Excerpt (“Required keys” row):  
    *Required keys*  alpn or equivalent

Issue Description:  
The summary in Appendix A specifies the required keys for the DNS SVCB mapping as “alpn or equivalent.” While Section 4.1 details that the absence of the “alpn” SvcParamKey forces a client to treat the SVCB record as “incompatible” (unless some other recognized SvcParam indicates a supported protocol), the document does not define which other key(s) (if any) may be considered “equivalent” to “alpn.” This lack of definition creates an underspecification.

Impact and Reasoning:  
• The “alpn” key (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) is central to indicating which protocols a DNS service supports.  
• By stating “or equivalent” without clarification, the document leaves it open to interpretation whether some other SvcParamKey might substitute for “alpn.”  
• Such ambiguity forces implementers to “guess” what might satisfy the requirement, leading to divergent implementations.  
 – Concrete Example: One DNS resolver implementation might assume that the presence of a “dohpath” key could be interpreted as an alternative means to indicate supported protocols, thus accepting the record. In contrast, another implementation might require an explicit “alpn” key and reject a record that only provides an “or equivalent” alternative. This discrepancy would result in inconsistent handling of SVCB records between implementations.
