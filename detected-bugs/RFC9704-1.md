## Inappropriate Reference for Full DNSSEC Validation

- [RFC 9704 - Establishing Local DNS Authority in Validated Split-Horizon Environments](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9704)
- **Category**: (U-4) Incorrect/missing references
- **Status**: Pending

Excerpt from Section 6.2:  
  “The client resolves the Verification Record using any resolution method of its choice (e.g., querying one of the network‐provided resolvers, performing iterative resolution locally) and performs full DNSSEC validation locally [RFC6698]. The result is processed based on its DNSSEC validation state (Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]):  
   • Secure: …  
   • Bogus or Indeterminate: …  
   • Insecure: …”

Explanation of the Issue:  
In Section 6.2 the RFC instructs clients to perform “full DNSSEC validation locally [RFC6698]” yet then directs processing based on DNSSEC validation state as defined in Section 4.3 of RFC4035. The full DNSSEC validation procedure—including the construction of a chain of trust and the interpretation of the validation state—is defined primarily in RFC4035. In contrast, RFC6698 pertains to DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) for TLSA record associations and does not describe the general validation procedures expected here.

This inappropriate reference is potentially misleading and may cause implementers to consult the wrong document for DNSSEC validation guidance. To eliminate ambiguity, the reference should point to RFC4035 or be clarified so that the reader understands that the DNSSEC validation method is as defined in RFC4035, not RFC6698.

Notes:  
• The use of RFC6698 in this context is unexpected for “full DNSSEC validation” and creates conflicting guidance when compared with the later reference to RFC4035.  
• Correcting this reference is important to ensure that implementers use the complete and proper procedures for DNSSEC validation, thereby reducing the risk of misinterpretation and implementation errors.
