## Underspecification of the "publication" Member Format

- [RFC 9224 - Finding the Authoritative Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Service](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9224)
- **Category**: (U-3) Indirect under-specification

Excerpt from Section 10.2:
  publication:  a MEMBER with MEMBER-NAME "publication" and MEMBER-VALUE a STRING

Explanation:
Section 3 of RFC 9224 specifies that “The syntax of the 'publication' value conforms to the Internet date/time format [RFC3339].” In contrast, the formal syntax in Section 10.2 defines “publication” solely as a JSON STRING without mandating the RFC3339 format. This is an underspecification in the formal definition: without an explicit constraint reflecting the RFC3339 requirement, implementations might accept arbitrary strings for the publication timestamp. For example, a client might erroneously accept a date formatted as "2024/01/07 10:11:12" rather than the required "2024-01-07T10:11:12Z", leading to ambiguities in date interpretation and caching behavior.
