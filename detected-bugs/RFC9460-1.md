## Inaccurate ABNF for dec‑octet

- [RFC 9460 - Service Binding and Parameter Specification via the DNS (SVCB and HTTPS Resource Records)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9460)
- **Category**: (I-1) Direct inconsistency
- **Status**: Pending

Excerpt from Appendix A:
```
  dec‑octet   = ( "0" / "1" ) 2DIGIT /
          "2" ( ( %x30-34 DIGIT ) / ( "5" %x30-35 ) )
```

Issue and Explanation:
The ABNF for dec‑octet as specified in RFC 9460 requires that a backslash escape representing an octet consist of exactly three decimal digits (e.g., “\123”). However, the DNS “character‑string decoding” algorithm as defined in RFC 1035 permits a backslash escape to consist of one to three decimal digits (thus allowing escapes such as “\5” or “\42”). As a result, an implementation adhering strictly to RFC 9460’s ABNF may incorrectly reject valid escape sequences that are permitted by RFC 1035. This inconsistency between RFC 9460’s ABNF and the established behavior in RFC 1035 can lead to interoperability issues.

Notes:
• If an implementation enforces a three‑digit requirement on backslash-escaped octets, zone files containing escapes with fewer than three digits will be rejected despite being correct per RFC 1035.
• This discrepancy falls under a “non‑compliance with documented standards” inconsistency, requiring clarification to ensure uniform parsing behavior in implementations.
