## Unclear Ordering of QTYPE Values in Multi‐QTYPE Queries

- [RFC 9567 - DNS Error Reporting](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9567)
- **Category**: (U-2) Direct under-specification (incomplete constraints)
  
Excerpt from Section 6.1.1:
  "... The QTYPE that was used in the query that resulted in the extended DNS error, presented as a decimal value, in a single DNS label. If additional QTYPEs were present in the query, such as described in [MULTI-QTYPES ], they are represented as unique, ordered decimal values separated by a hyphen. As an example, if both QTYPE A and AAAA were present in the query, they are presented as the label '1-28'."  

Explanation:  
The RFC directs that multiple QTYPEs be encoded as hyphen-separated decimal values but fails to define the ordering—whether it should be numerical (ascending or descending), or retain the order from the original query. This ambiguity could cause resolvers to build nonidentical QNAMEs for the same error condition.

Reasoning and Example:  
For example, if one resolver orders the QTYPEs numerically in ascending order (yielding "1-28") while another preserves the query’s original order (which could conceivably be "28-1"), the monitoring agent might interpret these report queries differently, resulting in misaligned error context.
