Excerpts from section 3:

 • DoH example:  
  _dns.example.net.  7200  IN SVCB 1 example.net. (  
    alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} )

 • DoT example:  
  _dns.example.net.  7200  IN SVCB 1 dot.example.net (  
    alpn=dot port=8530 )

 • DoQ example:  
  _dns.example.net.  7200  IN SVCB 1 doq.example.net (  
    alpn=doq port=8530 )

Issue Summary:  
There is an inconsistent presentation of TargetNames in the SVCB record examples. In the DoH example the TargetName “example.net.” is rendered with a trailing dot (indicating an absolute, fully qualified domain name), whereas in the DoT and DoQ examples the TargetNames “dot.example.net” and “doq.example.net” are provided without the trailing dot. Given that DNS zone file syntax treats names with and without a trailing dot differently (with the latter being subject to origin expansion), this inconsistency could lead to confusion and potentially unintended lookup behavior when implementations interpret the names.

Detailed Explanation and Reasoning:  
• According to DNS best practices and zone file conventions, an FQDN must consistently be represented with a trailing dot to avoid misinterpretation as a relative name.  
• If an implementer relies on these examples, the omission of the trailing dot in the DoT and DoQ examples might cause software to append the zone origin—potentially resulting in names such as “dot.example.net.<origin>”—which would be incorrect if the intent is to specify an absolute domain name.  
• The inconsistency is not an intentional protocol variation but appears to be an editorial oversight. Uniform representation (either including or omitting the trailing dot uniformly) would eliminate ambiguity about the target names and ensure correct name resolution across implementations.
