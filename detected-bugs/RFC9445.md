Excerpt from Section 7:
```

Issue:  
In the table header, the fourth column is labeled “Challenge” instead of “Access‐Challenge.” Standard RADIUS terminology (as defined in RFC 2865 and subsequent documents) uses the full message type “Access‐Challenge.” Since the other packet types in the table are fully specified (“Access‐Request,” “Access‐Accept,” “Access‐Reject”), the omission of the “Access‐” prefix for the challenge message creates an ambiguity.

Explanation:  
• Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of RFC 9445 specify in which RADIUS packet types the DHCP Options Attributes are allowed. In the corresponding table (Section 7), while the first three columns clearly denote “Access‐Request,” “Access‐Accept,” and “Access‐Reject,” the fourth column’s header using only “Challenge” leaves it open to misinterpretation.  
• This ambiguity is problematic because, according to RADIUS standards, the correct message type is “Access‐Challenge,” and a failure to use the full designation may lead implementers to diverge in their handling of the attribute.  
• For example, one implementation might (incorrectly) permit the DHCP options attribute in a packet labeled simply “Challenge” (interpreting it as a generic challenge message) while another implementation might enforce the absence of the attribute when a packet does not explicitly match “Access‐Challenge.” Such divergence can lead to interoperability issues between implementations from different vendors.

Reasoning:  
The underspecification is due to an ambiguous terminology: while “Challenge” might be understood in context by some experts, the inconsistency with the fully specified names in the same table leaves room for confusion. Given the importance of unambiguous message type identification in RADIUS (a crucial element for correct protocol behavior), this appears to be a genuine error rather than a mere editorial choice.
