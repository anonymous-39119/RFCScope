## Inconsistent Representation of the ZONEMD Hash Algorithm

- [RFC 9704 - Establishing Local DNS Authority in Validated Split-Horizon Environments](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9704)
- **Category**: (I-2) Indirect inconsistency
- **Status**: Pending

Sections Affected:
  • Section 5.1 (“Example”) – The authorization claim example lists:
    “Hash Algorithm = SHA-384 [RFC6234]”
  • Section 5.2.2 (JSON Encoding) and Table 1 in Section 13.3 – The “algorithm” field is shown as:
    "algorithm": "SHA384"

Detailed Explanation:
 The RFC specifies that the authorization claim must include a ZONEMD Hash Algorithm value. In Section 5.1 the algorithm is rendered with a hyphen (“SHA-384”), while the JSON representation in Section 5.2.2 and Table 1 uses “SHA384” (without a hyphen). Since the “algorithm” field is meant to directly use the mnemonic string from the ZONEMD Hash Algorithms registry (as established in Section 5.3 of [RFC8976]), this discrepancy might cause implementers to question whether the hyphen is significant. Inconsistent representation during implementation comparisons could lead to mismatches when verifying the associated records.

Notes:
 It is important that both representations be reconciled so that the registry mnemonic is used uniformly.
