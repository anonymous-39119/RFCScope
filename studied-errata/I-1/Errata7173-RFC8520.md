```
Section 9 says:


Within each access list, access is permitted to packets flowing to or from the Thing that can be mapped to the domain name of "service.bms.example.com".

It should say:

Within each access list, access is permitted to packets flowing to or from the Thing that can be mapped to the domain name of "test.example.com".

Notes:

The subdomain in the Figure does not correspond to the one in the text.
```

## Explanation

The text describes access control for "service.bms.example.com", which is inconsistent with the diagram showing "test.example.com".  This discrepancy affects the understanding of the example and its implementation.
