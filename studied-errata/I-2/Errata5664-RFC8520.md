# Errata 5664 - RFC 8520

- **RFC Title:** Manufacturer Usage Description Specification
- **RFC Publication Date:** March 2019
- Link to original errata report: [rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5664](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5664)

```
Throughout the document, when it says:


Universal Resource Locator

Universal Resource Name

It should say:

Uniform Resource Locator

Uniform Resource Name

Notes:

Note that there are multiple instances throughout the document.

There haven't been UNIVERSAL resource locators, identifiers, or names for twenty years.    I've labeled these as technical errata because they refer to something that doesn't exist.
```

## Explanation

The RFC uses "Universal Resource Locator" and "Universal Resource Name" throughout the document, while the correct terms are "Uniform Resource Locator" and "Uniform Resource Name".  The use of the incorrect terms represents an inconsistency and may cause confusion for implementers.
