# Errata 7588 - RFC 8325

- **RFC Title:** Mapping Diffserv to IEEE 802.11
- **RFC Publication Date:** February 2018
- Link to original errata report: [rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7588](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7588)

```
Section 2.3 says:


There are mappings provided in [IEEE.802.11-2016], Annex V Tables V-1 and V2,

It should say:

There are mappings provided in [IEEE.802.11-2016], Annex R Tables R-1 and R-2,

Notes:

It is Annex R in both the 2016 and 2020 editions
```

## Explanation

The original text refers to Annex V Tables V-1 and V2 in [IEEE.802.11-2016], which is incorrect. The mappings are actually in Annex R Tables R-1 and R-2, creating an inconsistency between the reference and the actual location of the mappings.
