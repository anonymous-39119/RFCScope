Errata Report for RFC 9619 – In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One

Section(s):  
• Section 1 (Introduction) – as it pertains to parameters referenced by Section 3

Excerpt from Section 1, Introduction:  
  “…provide a description of the semantic and practical requirements for DNS queries that naturally constrain the allowable values of QDCOUNT; and update the DNS base specification to clarify the allowable values of the QDCODE parameter in the specific case of DNS messages with OPCODE = 0.”

Explanation of the Issue:  
The document’s Introduction uses the term “QDCODE” when referring to the parameter for which almost every other reference in RFC 9619 (including Section 3 and Section 4) uses “QDCOUNT” (the DNS header field that counts the number of questions). There is no defined “QDCODE” in the DNS specifications. This appears to be a typographical error and creates an inconsistency in the naming of the parameter. Since Section 3’s title “QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One” (and the remainder of the document) consistently uses “QDCOUNT,” the inadvertent use of “QDCODE” in Section 1 can lead to confusion over which parameter is being discussed.

Notes:  
• The error involves a single incorrect letter substitution, but its resolution is important because correct and consistent parameter names are vital for implementers and for avoiding ambiguity in the DNS protocol specification.
• No other inconsistencies regarding the use or semantics of QDCOUNT in Section 3 were found.
