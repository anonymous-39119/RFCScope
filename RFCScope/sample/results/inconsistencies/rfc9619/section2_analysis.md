Below is the errata report for Section 2 of RFC 9619:

Errata: Inconsistent Normative Keyword List in Section 2

RFC: 9619  
Title: In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One  
Section: 2. Terminology Used in This Document

Excerpt from Section 2:
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
  capitals, as shown here.

Issue:
The list of normative keywords includes an extra entry—"NOT RECOMMENDED"—that does not appear in the standard keyword sets defined by RFC 2119 and RFC 8174. The commonly accepted set (as updated in RFC 8174) is:  
  "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".  
Including "NOT RECOMMENDED" introduces an additional normative term which may be interpreted as conveying a distinct level of requirement unexpectedly. This inconsistency could lead to ambiguity in implementations regarding the intended strength of recommendations.

Explanation:
Since RFC 2119 (and its update in RFC 8174) defines the standard list of normative key words without "NOT RECOMMENDED", the inclusion of this extra term is an error. It risks confusing implementers who are accustomed to the established list. The guidance should precisely follow the normative language specified in BCP 14. Removing or correcting "NOT RECOMMENDED" is necessary to ensure consistency with the documented standards.

────────────────────────────
Notes:
• The phrase “when, and only when, they appear in all capitals” is standard, but the unexpected addition of "NOT RECOMMENDED" deviates from accepted terminology.
• This error does not affect other sections of RFC 9619 but may lead to inconsistent interpretation of requirement levels if not addressed.

This errata report identifies an inconsistency in the normative keyword list that warrants correction to maintain conformity with BCP 14 as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.
