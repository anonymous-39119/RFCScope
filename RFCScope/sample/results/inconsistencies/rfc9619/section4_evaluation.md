Below is my step‐by‐step evaluation and then the final approved errata report.

Step‐by‐Step Evaluation

1. Recap of the Student’s Instructions and Findings:
 • The instructions required scanning every concept in the text, checking for conflicting statements (including differences in naming), and reporting any inconsistencies as errata. Each report must include the RFC number and title, specific sections that contain the inconsistency (with excerpts), a detailed explanation why the issue is an error, and any reasoning that links the excerpt to established standards (e.g., RFC 1035).
 • The student’s report for RFC 9619 identified that in Section 1 (Introduction) the text refers to the “QDCODE parameter” while Section 4 uses “QDCOUNT” (the established term per RFC 1035). The student explains that this incongruity is likely a typographical error that may confuse implementers.
 
2. Checklist Evaluation:
 2.1. Is the error something that the authors should clarify?  
  – The misnaming of a DNS header field is not merely a stylistic choice; it is a factual error that directly conflicts with RFC 1035. Even a small change in parameter naming can lead to misunderstandings in implementation.  
  => This error is significant and merits clarification.

 2.2. Is more clarification relevant in context?  
  – Yes. Since DNS implementations rely on the known, standard header field name “QDCOUNT” (as defined in RFC 1035), the inconsistent “QDCODE” in Section 1 must be corrected so that readers are not misled.  
  => The extra clarification is relevant.

 2.3. Is the inconsistency one of the types cited in the examples?  
  – Yes; it falls under “use of incorrect terms” as seen in the examples. The student’s finding mirrors issues such as misnaming parameters (like in Errata 6654 from RFC 7401) where an incorrect term is used in the text.
  => This confirms the inconsistency is of the “use of incorrect terms” type.

3. Reasoning and Suggestions:  
 – The student’s reasoning shows that the inconsistency is concrete: Section 1 wrongly uses “QDCODE” while Section 4 (and RFC 1035) uses “QDCOUNT.”  
 – Although the student could have further emphasized the direct quote from RFC 1035 for additional support, the provided explanation sufficiently demonstrates the error.
 – No other issues in Section 4 were found, so the focus on the naming error is appropriate.

Final Approved Errata Report

Errata Report for RFC 9619  
Title: In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One

Sections Affected:  
• Section 1 (Introduction) – contains the problematic reference  
  Excerpt:  
   “… update the DNS base specification to clarify the allowable values of the QDCODE parameter in the specific case of DNS messages with OPCODE = 0.”
  
• Section 4 (Updates to RFC 1035) – correctly refers to the parameter as QDCOUNT  
  Excerpt:  
   “A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT include a QDCOUNT parameter whose value is greater than 1…”
  
Explanation of the Issue:  
The DNS header field for the number of questions is defined in RFC 1035 as QDCOUNT. In RFC 9619’s Introduction (Section 1), the text incorrectly uses “QDCODE” instead of “QDCOUNT.” This misnaming appears to be a typographical error. Since consistent use of terminology is critical—especially in protocol specifications—it is important that all references to this parameter use the correct term (QDCOUNT) to avoid possible confusion among implementers and readers.

Notes:  
– The intended and standard parameter is QDCOUNT, as confirmed in RFC 1035 and consistently used in Section 4 of this document.  
– Correcting “QDCODE” to “QDCOUNT” will maintain clarity and prevent misinterpretation of the specification.

Conclusion

After careful evaluation, I find that the student’s report is well-reasoned and clearly documents a valid inconsistency that should be corrected. I therefore approve this errata report for submission to the IETF portal.
