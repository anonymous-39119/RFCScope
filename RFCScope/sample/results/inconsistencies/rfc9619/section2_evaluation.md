Below is my evaluation of the student’s errata report for Section 2 of RFC 9619, followed by the final, formatted report that meets our strict criteria.

────────────────────────────
Step‐by‐Step Evaluation:

1. Review of Instructions and Findings:
 • The student was instructed to scan each concept in the text and identify any conflicting or inconsistent statements. In Section 2 of RFC 9619 the focus is on the normative keyword list.
 • The text in Section 2 reads:
  "The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here."
 • The student’s report notes that the appearance of the extra term "NOT RECOMMENDED" is inconsistent with the normative keyword set as defined by RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 (which typically does not include "NOT RECOMMENDED"). This is a valid finding.

2. Checklist Analysis:
 2.1. Is the error something the authors should clarify?  
  – The error targets the inclusion of "NOT RECOMMENDED" in the normative keyword list. Normative language is critical for correct interpretation of requirements. Adding an unexpected term may lead to ambiguity. This is not a case of being overly picky but a meaningful inconsistency.
 2.2. Is further clarification relevant?  
  – Yes. Normative keywords drive how implementers understand requirement levels. Clarifying that the list must strictly adhere to BCP 14 is important to avoid conflicting interpretations.
 2.3. Is this inconsistency of a recognized type?  
  – Yes. This falls under the “use of incorrect terms” inconsistency. The student correctly identifies that “NOT RECOMMENDED” is not part of the standard set defined by RFC 2119/RFC 8174 and that its inclusion may alter the intended meaning.

3. Reasoning Sufficiency:
 • The student’s report includes the exact excerpt from the RFC, a clear statement of the issue, and an explanation of the potential impact (i.e. ambiguity in requirement strength).  
 • This reasoning is sufficiently concrete and clearly tied to the normative text.

Final Formatted Errata Report for Submission:

Errata Title: Inconsistent Normative Keyword List in Section 2

RFC: 9619  
Title: In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One  
Section: 2. Terminology Used in This Document

Excerpt:
  "The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
  'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and
  'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here."

Issue:
The normative keyword list in Section 2 includes an extra entry—"NOT RECOMMENDED"—that is not part of the standard set defined by RFC 2119 and RFC 8174. The accepted normative keyword set does not include "NOT RECOMMENDED"; its inclusion may inadvertently signal an additional or distinct level of requirement, thereby introducing ambiguity in how implementers interpret the specification.

Explanation:
BCP 14 (as defined in RFC 2119 and clarified in RFC 8174) prescribes a specific set of keywords (e.g., "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL") for indicating requirement levels. The addition of "NOT RECOMMENDED" deviates from that standard. This inconsistency in the normative language can lead to misinterpretation of the intended obligation strength in the document. To ensure unambiguous guidance, the keyword list should strictly adhere to the established set.

Reviewer’s Note:
After careful analysis, I find the student's report is valid and technically rigorous. This errata should be submitted to the IETF portal.

Conclusion:
I am accepting this errata report for submission.
