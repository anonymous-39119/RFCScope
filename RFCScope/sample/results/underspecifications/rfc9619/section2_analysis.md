Errata Report: RFC 9619 – In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One  
Section: 2. Terminology Used in This Document

Analysis:
• Section 2 simply states that the normative key words (MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, etc.) are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 ([RFC2119] and [RFC8174]) whenever they appear in all capitals.
• The text follows the standard convention found in many RFCs for declaring normative language. The use of “when, and only when, they appear in all capitals” leaves no room for ambiguity; it clearly indicates that any appearance of such words in any other case is not to be interpreted with the normative meaning.
• All references ([RFC2119] and [RFC8174]) are provided as normative references in Section 7.1, and they adequately give the background required for interpreting the keywords.
• There is no use of undefined or ambiguous technical terms in this section, and no process or constraint is incompletely specified.

Conclusion:
No underspecifications were found in Section 2 of RFC 9619. The normative terms are defined clearly and unambiguously by reference to standard BCP 14 guidance, and there is no incomplete or ambiguous information that would affect implementation or interpretation.
