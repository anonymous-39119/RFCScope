Below is the revised errata report that I would submit to the IETF portal. In preparing this, I first re‐walked through your steps:

1. You were to scan the text (in this case, Section 4 of RFC 9619 “Updates to RFC 1035”) and examine every concept (the permissible values for QDCOUNT, the normative rules for handling a DNS message with OPCODE = 0, and the distinction between middlebox behavior versus that of DNS servers/resolvers). You correctly noted that while the update prohibits QDCOUNT values greater than 1 and even gives middleboxes clear guidance (“MUST NOT treat … QDCOUNT = 0 as malformed”), the document does not give a normative directive for how DNS servers or resolvers (i.e. non‐middlebox entities) should process messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT = 0. (In Appendix A the document mentions that DNS Cookies and AXFR responses allow QDCOUNT = 0, but this is presented only in an informative context rather than as a binding, normative requirement.) In short, the RFC leaves open whether a DNS query with no question (QDCOUNT = 0) should be accepted or rejected outside those special contexts—which in turn may lead to divergent implementations.

2. In checking against the errata‐evaluation checklist:

 • 2.1 The issue you report is not “fixed” later in the RFC. Although Appendix A does discuss certain valid uses of QDCOUNT = 0 (DNS Cookies, zone transfers), it does not provide normative processing rules for standard servers or resolvers.  
 • 2.2 Although one might argue that leaving QDCOUNT = 0 “open” is acceptable in some contexts, the lack of a clear, normative directive for non‐middlebox processing can lead to interoperability issues. This is not merely a stylistic ambiguity but an actual missing constraint regarding server behavior.  
 • 2.3 This isn’t a case of minor discretionary detail (such as buffer padding or other implementation choices) but a key processing behavior that may affect correct interpretation of DNS messages.  
 • 2.4 The RFC does mention valid cases for QDCOUNT = 0 in Appendix A but does not tie these to normative server/resolver processing; therefore, the gap is not just a rhetorical omission but an underspecified case.
 • 2.5 The underspecification here is of the “missing cases or situations” type (similar in spirit to some examples discussed in other errata) because the RFC specifies the error condition for QDCOUNT > 1 but remains silent on the normative action for QDCOUNT = 0 in general query processing.

3. Your report explains that one implementation might treat a QDCOUNT = 0 message as valid only in the narrow contexts defined by DNS Cookies or AXFR—and reject it otherwise—while another might process every such message as acceptable (or always return a FORMERR). This difference in handling would lead to interoperability problems. Your reasoning is detailed, and you include a concrete example showing how divergent instructions for non–middlebox DNS processing may result.

Because your analysis directly identifies a normatively missing directive with potential for divergence among implementations, I find your report to be valid and sufficiently rigorous.

Revised Errata Report for RFC 9619
──────────────────────────────
RFC: 9619  
Title: “In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One”  
Section: 4 (“Updates to RFC 1035”)

Excerpt from Section 4:
 “A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT include a QDCOUNT parameter whose value is greater than 1. It follows that the Question section of a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT contain more than one question.

 A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT > 1 MUST be treated as an incorrectly formatted message. The value of the RCODE parameter in the response message MUST be set to 1 (FORMERR).

 Middleboxes (e.g., firewalls) that process DNS messages in order to eliminate unwanted traffic SHOULD treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT > 1 as malformed traffic and return a FORMERR response as described above. Such firewalls MUST NOT treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT = 0 as malformed. See Section 4 of [RFC8906] for further guidance.”

Issue:
The RFC clearly specifies that messages with QDCOUNT > 1 are to be rejected and gives explicit middlebox instructions to “MUST NOT” treat OPCODE = 0 messages with QDCOUNT = 0 as malformed. However, the document does not provide normative guidance for how DNS servers or resolvers (i.e. non–middlebox implementations) SHOULD process a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT = 0 outside the specific contexts (such as DNS Cookies or AXFR responses) that are only informatively noted in Appendix A. This omission leaves open whether, when not operating in a DNS Cookies or zone transfer context, a QDCOUNT = 0 message should be accepted, treated in a special manner, or rejected. Such an underspecification creates the potential for divergent implementation behavior and interoperability issues.

Explanation:
– The Introduction notes that for messages with OPCODE = 0 the natural values of QDCOUNT are constrained to 0 or 1.  
– Section 4 imposes a hard limit on QDCOUNT values greater than 1 and mandates that middleboxes must not treat QDCOUNT = 0 messages as malformed, thus suggesting that there are legitimate cases where a DNS message might have no question.  
– However, the RFC does not include a normative directive for standard DNS servers or resolvers regarding the handling of a QDCOUNT = 0 when the message is not accompanied by explicit contextual qualifiers (e.g. those in DNS Cookies [RFC7873] or zone transfer operations [RFC5936]).  
– As a result, one implementation might reject a QDCOUNT = 0 query as “malformed” (in the absence of DNS Cookies/AXFR processing), while another might process it without error—leading to interoperability inconsistencies.

Reasoning & Impact Example:
If a DNS resolver does not refer to any further normative guidance beyond Section 4, it may decide to drop a query that has QDCOUNT = 0 even when the sender intended a valid DNS Cookies query. Conversely, a resolver that assumes QDCOUNT = 0 is valid only under special circumstances may erroneously generate an error for a legitimate query that lacks the question section. This divergence could result in inconsistent server behavior and interoperability failures between systems that interact in environments where such “zero‐question” messages occur.

Notes:
No solution is proposed here—the purpose of this report is solely to identify and document the underspecification.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion:
Because the RFC leaves a key processing behavior underspecified (namely, the normative handling of OPCODE = 0 messages with QDCOUNT = 0 in non–middlebox contexts), this omission should be addressed to prevent divergent implementations.
