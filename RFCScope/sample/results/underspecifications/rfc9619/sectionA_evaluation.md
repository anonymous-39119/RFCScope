Below is my detailed evaluation of the student’s three errata reports for RFC 9619, along with my reasoning according to our strict checklist. I have examined each report step‐by‐step against the instructions:

────────────────────────────
1. Errata Report 1: Ambiguity in the QDCOUNT Value for DNS NOTIFY Requests  
────────────────────────────
• Student’s Report Summary:  
  – Location: Section A.2 (“OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY)”)  
  – Excerpt: The text of RFC 9619 states that for DNS NOTIFY the RFC [RFC1996] “requires … QDCOUNT>0” while all other discussion implies a singular <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE> tuple.  
  – Explanation: The report argues that “QDCOUNT>0” means that values other than 1 are formally allowed even though all descriptive text elsewhere implies exactly one question. This ambiguity may lead to divergent implementations if a message were sent with, say, QDCOUNT = 2.  

• Checklist Evaluation:  
  2.1. The claimed ambiguity is not “fixed” or clarified later in the document.  
  2.2. The issue is not merely stylistic—the term “>0” is used in a normative statement in RFC 1996 while the rest of the text suggests a singular tuple.  
  2.3. This is not a minor implementation discretion but a real mismatch that can cause interoperability issues.  
  2.4. The underspecification is clearly about the ambiguity in the allowed range of QDCOUNT in the NOTIFY case.  
  2.5. It fits the example of “direct under-specification due to ambiguous terms” since “>0” versus “a single tuple” leaves room for different interpretations.  
  2.6. Sufficient reasoning is provided; for example, if one DNS implementation accepts a NOTIFY with QDCOUNT = 2 while another rejects it, then inconsistent behavior would result.  

• Conclusion:  
  This report is unquestionably valid. I therefore ACCEPT Errata Report 1 to be submitted to the IETF portal, with only minor editorial improvements if desired.

────────────────────────────
2. Errata Report 2: Unclear Normative Boundaries for Allowing QDCOUNT = 0 in OPCODE = 0 Queries  
────────────────────────────
• Student’s Report Summary:  
  – Location: Section A.1 (“OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and 1 (IQUERY)”)  
  – Excerpt: The text describes that although Section 4 of RFC 9619 mandates QDCOUNT MUST NOT be greater than 1 for standard queries, exceptions exist (DNS Cookies [RFC7873] and AXFR responses [RFC5936]) that use QDCOUNT = 0.  
  – Explanation: The report claims that it is not made explicit under which circumstances a QDCOUNT = 0 is valid and how a DNS receiver should differentiate a correctly formed exception from an erroneously formed message.

• Checklist Evaluation:  
  2.1. The “exceptions” are clearly referenced (to RFC7873 and RFC5936) and are non‐normative guidance in an appendix rather than a normative update.  
  2.2. It appears that RFC 9619 deliberately defers to the normative details found in the referenced RFCs for DNS Cookies and AXFR; therefore, the lack of a “conditional statement” here reflects that cross‐document reliance rather than an oversight.  
  2.3. While potentially inconvenient if one were reading RFC 9619 in isolation, this use of descriptive language (e.g. “allow” and “optionally send”) is typical for such discussions and falls into a realm of implementation discretion.  
  2.4. Hence, this “underspecification” is too fine a point given that an implementer will also consult RFC7873 and RFC5936 for the precise rules.  

• Conclusion:  
  This report does not meet our strict threshold for a clear and unquestionably valid errata submission. I therefore REJECT Errata Report 2.

────────────────────────────
3. Errata Report 3: Lack of Guidance for QDCOUNT in OPCODE = 2 (STATUS) Messages  
────────────────────────────
• Student’s Report Summary:  
  – Location: Section A.5 (“Conclusion”)  
  – Excerpt: The text notes “OPCODE = 1 (IQUERY) is obsolete and OPCODE = 2 (STATUS) is not specified. OPCODE = 3 is reserved.”  
  – Explanation: The report argues that because no guidance is offered for QDCOUNT in STATUS messages, implementers may diverge in behavior.

• Checklist Evaluation:  
  2.1. The document explicitly states that for OPCODE = 2 (STATUS) the allowed values are “not specified.” That is an intentional choice rather than an oversight.  
  2.2. While a reader might wish for normative guidance, the text clearly informs that STATUS is outside the scope of the intended clarification.  
  2.3. This falls under “missing constraints” only if it were an error – but here the RFC plainly declares the lack of specification, so it is not an error per se.  
  2.4. As such, this detail does not rise to the level of an implementation‐affecting underspecification in our view.  

• Conclusion:  
  I REJECT Errata Report 3 as it does not identify an error but rather states a deliberate aspect of the document.

Final Submission to the IETF Portal  
────────────────────────────
Only the following errata report meets our strict criteria for submission:

────────────────────────────
Errata Report: Ambiguity in the QDCOUNT Value for DNS NOTIFY Requests  
────────────────────────────

RFC Number and Title:  
  RFC 9619 – “In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One”

Section:  
  Section A.2 – OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY)

Excerpt from the Text:  
  “DNS Notify [RFC1996] also lacks a clearly defined range of values for QDCOUNT. Section 3.7 states that:  
   'A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT>0'  
  However, all other text in the RFC discusses the <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE> tuple in the singular form.”

Detailed Explanation:  
  The text mandates in RFC 1996 that a NOTIFY request has a QDCOUNT greater than zero, which formally permits any positive integer. However, throughout RFC 1996 the discussion of question sections is phrased in the singular (i.e. one <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE> tuple). This discrepancy creates an ambiguity: without explicit normative language (for example, “MUST equal 1”), an implementation might accept a NOTIFY request with multiple questions (a QDCOUNT greater than 1), while another implementation might reject any message not containing exactly one question. Such divergent interpretations can lead to interoperability issues in DNS NOTIFY processing.

Notes/Reasoning:  
  Because the ambiguity is not resolved elsewhere in RFC 9619 and since the normative statement in RFC 1996 simply requires QDCOUNT to be >0, there is a genuine underspecification. For example, if one DNS server accepts a notification with QDCOUNT = 2 (interpreting multiple queries as valid) and another server strictly expects a single question and rejects such messages, the resulting behavior differences could cause communication failures in DNS zone change notifications.

────────────────────────────
Summary of Evaluation:  
  • Errata Report 1 is accepted for submission.  
  • Errata Reports 2 and 3 are rejected because they either relate to cross‐referenced normative documents (or are intentional in stating that no guidance is provided) and do not represent an unambiguous underspecification affecting interoperability.

This is the final, well‐formatted errata report I will submit to the IETF portal.
