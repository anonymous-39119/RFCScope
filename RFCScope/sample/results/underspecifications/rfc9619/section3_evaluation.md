Below is my evaluation of the student’s errata report for RFC 9619, Section 3, followed by my final decision.

────────────────────────────
Evaluation Summary

Step 1. Restating the Student’s Instructions and Findings

• You were asked to examine the text of RFC 9619 “In the DNS, QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One” concept‐by‐concept, looking for underspecifications (undefined or ambiguous terms, incomplete information, missing constraints, etc.).  
• For each concept, you were to decide if the apparent “underspecification” actually left room for divergent implementations—unless the issue was clarified in later parts of the text or was merely non‐normative summary.  
• For each valid underspecification the errata report should include: the RFC number/title, exact section references with excerpts, a detailed explanation and reasoning that the lack of precision would cause divergent implementations, and the identification of the type of underspecification.

In your report you identified two “issues” in Section 3 of RFC 9619:

Issue 1. “Ambiguous Use of ‘Usually’”  
  – You noted that the title “QDCOUNT Is (Usually) One” uses the adverb “usually” without a precise definition, leaving open the possibility for multiple interpretations.

Issue 2. “Lack of Explicit Description of the Ambiguity for OPCODE = 0”  
  – You argued that although the text mentions an ambiguity for OPCODE = 0, it does not explain which aspects of earlier guidance (e.g., from RFC 1035, DNS Cookies, or AXFR responses) lead to uncertainty, leaving implementers confused about when a 0 value would be acceptable versus when a value of 1 is required.

Step 2. Evaluation Against the Checklist

2.1. Entire Document Context  
 – The checklist clearly reminds us that any information “underspecified” in one section must be ignored if it is later clarified in the document. In RFC 9619, although Section 3 is brief and uses non‐normative language (“usually”), the normative updates (and precise requirements) appear in Section 4. In consequence, the document as a whole clearly mandates (for OPCODE = 0 messages) that QDCOUNT is not allowed to be greater than 1.  
  ⇒ Thus, the supposed ambiguity in Section 3 is resolved later.

2.2. Relevance Versus Rhetorical Style  
 – Section 3 is intended as an overview (a “brief summary”) of the historical guidance from RFC 1035 and others. The use of “usually” in that context reflects the historical informal wording rather than an intended normative statement.  
  ⇒ Reporting a stylistic choice (or a “summary style” ambiguity) that is later negated by explicit normative requirements is overly nitpicky.

2.3. Implementation Impact  
 – For an underspecification to be reported for errata, one must show that differing interpretations (e.g., an implementation choosing QDCOUNT = 0 versus QDCOUNT = 1) would lead to interoperability problems. In this case, Section 4 clearly says that a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT have QDCOUNT > 1, and notes that while QDCOUNT = 0 is acceptable in some scenarios (such as DNS Cookies or AXFR responses), the overall normative text guides proper behavior.  
  ⇒ The two “issues” would not cause divergent implementations because implementers are expected to read the entire document—including normative Section 4—where the intended behavior is unambiguously specified.

2.4. Oversensitivity Versus Genuine Underspecification  
 – The identified “issues” appear to be based on the observation that a summary section is less explicit than the normative sections that follow. This is acceptable editorial or stylistic choice for a summary—not a true underspecification affecting system behavior.  
  ⇒ The report is overly eager in picking up on non‐normative phrasing.

2.5. Identification of Issue Type and Sufficient Reasoning  
 – Neither issue is a clear case of “undefined term” or missing constraint that would truly cause divergent implementations in the field. While you provided reasoning, you did not give a concrete example of how the ambiguous use of “usually” or the brief mention of OPCODE = 0 would lead to conflicting implementations—the clarifications in later sections serve that purpose.
  ⇒ Thus, the report does not meet the burden of “undeniable underspecification.”

Step 3. Final Decision

Based on the above considerations:
 • The ambiguities you identified in Section 3 are inherent to its non‐normative, summary nature and are subsequently resolved (and clarified normatively) in Section 4 and Appendix A.  
 • Reporting these as underspecifications is not warranted under our guidelines (see points 2.1 and 2.2), and the current level of ambiguity does not leave room for divergent, interoperability‐threatening implementations.

Conclusion

As a result of my careful evaluation, I must REJECT the student’s errata report for RFC 9619. The issues raised (ambiguous use of “usually” and the lack of explicit in‐section detail about OPCODE = 0) are either stylistic summarization choices or are resolved later in the document and do not qualify as under-specifications that would risk divergent implementations.

No version of the errata report will be submitted to the IETF Portal in its current form.

Final Decision: REJECT

If you wish to revise the report, please provide a clear example of how the identified ambiguities cause divergent interpretations when an implementer reads only part of the document—and demonstrate that such behavior is not addressed by the normative updates later in the text.
